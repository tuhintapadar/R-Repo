# **1. Introduction**

I think for the last few decades globalisation has made a tremendous effect on human history. It is claimed that the globalisation just not only breaks the barriers of trade but also uplift the well-being of the society in general and I want to see how successful that claim is! And I have taken the help of **R** to explore that claim.

The idea of this task is to explore various capabilities of R in terms of data import, clean, explore and visualisation. And for this purpose I have chosen three datasets:

A.	World GDP Data between 1960 to 2018
B.	World population data between 1960 to 2018.
C.  World life expectancy data for the same period.

All the datasets are available for free from the World Bank site <https://data.worldbank.org> under *Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC-BY 4.0)* license. 



## **1.1. Objective**

I have tried to maintain this data flow for the data science as shown in the below figure i.e. import of data then tidy-up data, next transform them as necessary and then create a data model for the visualization and communicate the process with the audience. Except for some standard statistical analysis, we are not doing any kind of machine learning algorithm for this task. Therefore, the data model that we have created here is solely for the data analysis and visualization purpose.


## **1.2.	Source of dataset**
* World GDP Data between 1960 to 2018.                   https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.mktp.cd 
* World population data between 1960 to 2018.            https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
* World life expectancy data for the same period.        https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN

All though these data are coming from diffent data source I have merge them into a single data-set for our analysis. Having said that I have also subset the data whenever it is necessary.
